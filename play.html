                <h6 class="name ORGON">ORGON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Hello, brother!</p>
                <h6 class="name CLEANTE">CLEANTE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">I'm glad you've returned before my departure.
                    The countryside isn't quite blossoming yet.</p>
                <h6 class="name ORGON">ORGON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">DORINE . . . One second brother, please!  Just let
                    Me set my heart at ease and soothe my fear
                    Concerning the things that have happened here.<p class="direction">[To Dorine.]</p>                
                    For these past two days, how have things gone on?
                    What has happened?  And how is everyone?</p>
                <h6 class="name DORINE">DORINE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">The first day your wife had a bad fever
                    And a headache that just wouldn't leave her.</p>
                <h6 class="name ORGON">ORGON.</h6>
                <p class="speech"> And Tartuffe?</p>
                <h6 class="name DORINE">DORINE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Tartuffe?  He's in splendid shape,
                    Fat and flabby, with red lips, and a shining face.</p>
                <h6 class="name ORGON">ORGON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Poor fellow!</p>
                <h6 class="name DORINE">DORINE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">That night, your wife felt so sick
                    And so feverish that she could only pick
                    At her dinner and scarcely ate a bite.</p>
                <h6 class="name ORGON">ORGON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">And Tartuffe?</p>
                <h6 class="name DORINE">DORINE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">He alone ate with all his might,
                    And devoutly devoured a pair of pheasants
                    And a leg of lamb in our lady's presence.</p>
                <h6 class="name ORGON">ORGON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Poor fellow!</p>
                <h6 class="name DORINE">DORINE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">The whole night passed before she
                    Could even close her eyes to fall asleep;
                    Shivers and chills beset her in bed,
                    And right up till dawn we watched her with dread.</p>
                <h6 class="name ORGON">ORGON.</h6>
                <p class="speech">And Tartuffe?</p>
                <h6 class="name DORINE">DORINE.</h6>
                <p class="speech">Drowsy from all that he'd consumed,
                    He left the table, went straight to his room,
                    And fell quickly into his nice, warm sack
                    Where he slept all night flat on his back.</p>
